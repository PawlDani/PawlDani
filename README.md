👋 Hey there! I’m @PawlDani, a full-stack developer who loves building cool stuff for the web and mobile.

✨ I spend most of my time working with React, React Native, Node.js, and diving into databases like SQL and Prisma. Whether it’s crafting smooth user interfaces or setting up solid backends, I’m all in.

🚀 My coding journey started with React Native, and now I’ve grown into a full-stack role, loving every part of the process.

🤝 I’m always up for interesting projects, brainstorming sessions, or just geeking out over tech. Let’s connect and make something awesome together!
